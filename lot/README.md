Welcome to the **WWW'25 AgentSociety Challenge**! This repository provides the tools and framework needed to participate in a competition that focuses on building **LLM Agents** for **user behavior simulation** and **recommendation systems** based on open source datasets.

Participants are tasked with developing intelligent agents that interact with a simulated environment and perform specific tasks in two competition tracks:
1. **User Behavior Simulation Track**: Agents simulate user behavior, including generating reviews and ratings.
2. **Recommendation Track**: Agents generate recommendations based on provided contextual data.

This repository includes:
- The core library `websocietysimulator` for environment simulation.
- Scripts for dataset processing and analysis.
- Example usage for creating and evaluating agents.

---

## Directory Structure

### 1. **`websocietysimulator/`**  
This is the core library containing all source code required for the competition.

- **`agents/`**: Contains base agent classes (`SimulationAgent`, `RecommendationAgent`) and their abstractions. Participants must extend these classes for their implementations.
- **`task/`**: Defines task structures for each track (`SimulationTask`, `RecommendationTask`).
- **`llm/`**: Contains base LLM client classes (`DeepseekLLM`, `OpenAILLM`).
- **`tools/`**: Includes utility tools:
  - `InteractionTool`: A utility for interacting with the Yelp dataset during simulations.
  - `EvaluationTool`: Provides comprehensive metrics for both recommendation (HR@1/3/5) and simulation tasks (RMSE, sentiment analysis).
- **`simulator.py`**: The main simulation framework, which handles task and groundtruth setting, evaluation and agent execution.

### 2. **`example/`**  
Contains usage examples of the `websocietysimulator` library. Includes sample agents and scripts to demonstrate how to load scenarios, set agents, and evaluate them.

### 3. **`data_process.py`**  
A script to process the raw Yelp dataset into the required format for use with the `websocietysimulator` library. This script ensures the dataset is cleaned and structured correctly for simulations.

## Quick Start

### 1. Install the Library

The repository is organized using [Python Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/). Follow these steps to install the library:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <this_repo>
   cd websocietysimulator
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
  - Option 1: Install dependencies using Poetry: (Recommended)
    ```bash
    poetry install  && \
    poetry shell
    ```
  - Option 2: Install dependencies using pip(COMING SOON):
    ```bash
    pip install websocietysimulator
    ```
  - Option 3: Install dependencies using conda:
    ```bash
    conda create -n websocietysimulator python=3.11 && \
    conda activate websocietysimulator && \
    pip install -r requirements.txt && \
    pip install .
    ```

3. Verify the installation:
   ```python
   import websocietysimulator
   ```

---

### 2. Data Preparation

1. Download the raw dataset from the Yelp[1], Amazon[2] or Goodreads[3].
2. Run the `data_process.py` script to process the dataset:
   ```bash
   python data_process.py --input <path_to_raw_dataset> --output <path_to_processed_dataset>
   ```
- Check out the [Data Preparation Guide](./tutorials/data_preparation.md) for more information.
- **NOTICE: You Need at least 16GB RAM to process the dataset.**

---

### 3. Organize Your Data

Ensure the dataset is organized in a directory structure similar to this:

```
<your_dataset_directory>/
├── item.json
├── review.json
├── user.json
```

You can name the dataset directory whatever you prefer (e.g., `dataset/`).

---

### 4. Develop Your Agent

Create a custom agent by extending either `SimulationAgent` or `RecommendationAgent`. Refer to the examples in the `example/` directory. Here's a quick template:

```python
from yelpsimulator.agents.simulation_agent import SimulationAgent

class MySimulationAgent(SimulationAgent):
    def workflow(self):
        # The simulator will automatically set the task for your agent. You can access the task by `self.task` to get task information.
        print(self.task)

        # You can also use the `interaction_tool` to get data from the dataset.
        # For example, you can get the user information by `interaction_tool.get_user(user_id="example_user_id")`.
        # You can also get the item information by `interaction_tool.get_item(item_id="example_item_id")`.
        # You can also get the reviews by `interaction_tool.get_reviews(review_id="example_review_id")`.
        user_info = interaction_tool.get_user(user_id="example_user_id")

        # Implement your logic here
        
        # Finally, you need to return the result in the format of `stars` and `review`.
        # For recommendation track, you need to return a candidate list of items, in which the first item is the most recommended item.
        stars = 4.0
        review = "Great experience!"
        return stars, review
```

### 5. Evaluation your agent with training data

Run the simulation using the provided `Simulator` class:

```python
from websocietysimulator import Simulator
from my_agent import MySimulationAgent

# Initialize Simulator
simulator = Simulator(data_dir="path/to/your/dataset", device="auto", cache=False)
# The cache parameter controls whether to use cache for interaction tool.
# If you want to use cache, you can set cache=True. When using cache, the simulator will only load data into memory when it is needed, which saves a lot of memory.
# If you want to use normal interaction tool, you can set cache=False. Notice that, normal interaction tool will load all data into memory at the beginning, which needs a lot of memory (20GB+).

# Load scenarios
simulator.set_task_and_groundtruth(task_dir="path/to/task_directory", groundtruth_dir="path/to/groundtruth_directory")

# Set your custom agent
simulator.set_agent(MySimulationAgent)

# Set LLM client
simulator.set_llm(DeepseekLLM(api_key="Your API Key"))

# Run evaluation
# If you don't set the number of tasks, the simulator will run all tasks.
agent_outputs = simulator.run_simulation(number_of_tasks=None, enable_threading=True, max_workers=10)

# Evaluate the agent
evaluation_results = simulator.evaluate()
```
- If you want to use your own LLMClient, you can easily implement it by inheriting the `LLMBase` class. Refer to the [Tutorial](./tutorials/agent_development.md) for more information.

## Introduction to the `InteractionTool`

The `InteractionTool` is the core utility for interacting with the dataset. It provides an interface for querying user, item, and review data.

### Functions

- **Get User Information**:
  Retrieve user data by user ID or current scenario context.
  ```python
  user_info = interaction_tool.get_user(user_id="example_user_id")
  ```

- **Get Item Information**:
  Retrieve item data by item ID or current scenario context.
  ```python
  item_info = interaction_tool.get_item(item_id="example_item_id")
  ```

- **Get Reviews**:
  Fetch reviews related to a specific item or user, filtered by time.
  ```python
  reviews = interaction_tool.get_reviews(review_id="example_review_id")  # Fetch a specific review
  reviews = interaction_tool.get_reviews(item_id="example_item_id")  # Fetch all reviews for a specific item
  reviews = interaction_tool.get_reviews(user_id="example_user_id")  # Fetch all reviews for a specific user
  ```
